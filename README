#Merge files
The code is written on the Linux system.

Code Description:
The code deals with files.
The software receives two files with a txt extension and reads from each of them a line and pastes them into a third file,
so that there is nothing more to read from any of the files.

Useful files in the code for testing purposes:
fileA.txt & fileB.txt (other txt files can be selected for testing).

After running:
After running you will see a file named fileC where the text from the filesA & filrB will be.
